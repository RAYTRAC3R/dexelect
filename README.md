## Introduction
_TeamGen_ generates (prescribes) a party for use in a playthrough — either to introduce an element of 
challenge or simply for team inspiration. See the [suggested rulesets](/docs/RULESETS.md) for some ideas about how to use _TeamGen_.

The app is **universal** in the sense that it maintains compatibility with most generations of Pokémon, 
_and_ with romhacks that might contain the following (as long as the relevant game data files are added):
- New Pokémon
- New locations 
- Changes to existing game data (location data, evolution methods, etc.)

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to add support for a romhack.

## Currently supported games
- **Vanilla**
  - Pokémon Red & Blue
  - Pokémon Gold & Silver
  - Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire
- **Romhacks**
  - [Pokémon Solus RGB](https://github.com/Dechrissen/poke-solus-rgb)

### Option 2: Command-line installation

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.10+
- `pip`
- (Optional) `venv`

Steps:
1. Clone this repository (or download the [latest release](https://github.com/Dechrissen/teamgen/releases/latest) 
   source code and extract it)
2. `cd teamgen`
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`)
4. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment  (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
5. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

7. Run `python main.py` for the GUI (for the CLI UI, run `python main.py --ui=cli`)


## Usage

### Using the GUI (`python main.py --ui=gui`)
- The app is split into sidebar (left) and main window (right)
- Left sidebar:
  - The mode can be toggled between 'Progression' and 'Random'
  - 'Acquisition details' and 'Balance stats' display can each be disabled
  - 'Reload config' button will reload the config files into the app if they were modified on disk while the app is running
- Main window:
  - "Generate" and "Config" tabs at the top can be switched between
  - Click "Generate party" to generate a party
  - Modify settings in the 'Config' tab if desired

### Using the CLI app (`python main.py --ui=cli`)
- `ENTER` – Generate a party with the current settings
- `M` – Toggle the generation mode between 'Progression' and 'Random'
  - Progression: Considers game data, locations, progression, config settings
  - Random: Completely random generation using current game's National Dex
- `G` – Open the 'Supported Games' menu to switch current game
- `R` – Reload the config file (after making any config changes while the app is running)
- `H` – Display help menu
- `Q` – Quit the app

#### Modifying config settings for the CLI app
Open `/config/config_gen1.yaml` (for example, for Generation 1 games). Modify values according to your preferences. 
Save the file and then, if the app was running, use the `R` option in the app to reload.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running the standalone binary, the config files are in `/_internal/config` and they can still be modified in a text editor (but the 'Config' tab in the GUI is preferred).
